#In OOP, objects and classes are the fundamental entities. Objects are created using classes. 
# One can observe that classes contain properties and that objects are created to manipulate 
# and access these properties. To make this object-oriented system more reliable and error free,
# it is a good practice to limit access to the class members at times.


# Information hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of a class 
# and simply providing an interface through which the outside world can interact 
# with the class without knowing whatâ€™s going on inside.


# Data hiding can be divided into two primary components:
# 1. Encapsulation
# 2. Abstraction


# Chapter 2 is about Encapsulation. 
# Abstraction will be covered in second Unit


# 1. Encapsulation:
# Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data together 
# in a single unit, that is, class.

# When encapsulating classes, a good convention is to declare all variables of a class private. 
# This will restrict direct access by the code outside that class.

# At this point, a question can be raised: If the methods and variables are encapsulated in a class,
# then how can they be used outside of that class?

# The answer to this is simple. One has to implement public methods to let the outside world 
# communicate with this class. These methods are called getters and setters. We can also implement other custom methods.


# Advantages of encapsulation 

 # * Classes make the code easy to change and maintain.
 # * Properties to be hidden can be specified easily.
 # * We decide which outside classes or functions can access the class properties.
