# How to declare a class in Python


class myClassName:

#All Properties and methods of this class will be defined inside here
# Easier terms for newbies: Properties -> Variables in the class
#                           Methods -> Functions (which may or may not return values)

    pass    #Python's way of saying just get it over with (if we have nothing to do here)

# Creating class object:

ObjectName = myClassName()

print(ObjectName) # This will print the memory address where this object is stored

#This is only basic implementation of a class and don't contain any properties or methods yet
